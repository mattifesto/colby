# Attributes

} Title

] The title will be shown in the larger characters than the description.

] The title will always be placed before the description.

] The title is the main lure to read a document, so making it compelling is very important.

] The title will be used as the tweet text on Twitter, so while not completely necessary, it should make at least some sense on its own outside of the document.

] I title only has end punctuation on the last sentence or fragment if it the punctuation is not a period. Since there is usually only one sentence or fragment and the end punctuation is usually a period, there should usually be no end punctuation.

] A current popular style is that titles are written with the same capitalization as sentences. That is, do not capitalize every word, but do capitalize proper nouns or locations that would be capitalized in a sentence. This is because this form reads easier and looks better on Twitter and Facebook where lots of capital letters looks very odd and unsocial.

] Using more complete sentences or at least phrases is a common trend. So instead of "Man Bites Dog", just say, "I bit a dog the other day, what was I thinking?" Don't make the reader decipher your "code" just to have a shorter title. Communicating clearly will attract more readers.

] A title is limited to 100 characters, but titles should usually be much shorter than that.


} Description

] The description is generally longer than the title, but that is not a rule. This is because the description often clarifies exactly what the shorter title means and what the document may actually contain.

] A description will be the description used by Google when the document is found in Google searches. Keep in mind often only the first part of the description is shown depending on the layout, so if you have an important word or words its best to place them first.

] A description is also limited to 100 characters, but it's fine if it often approaches that length.

] If a title makes the reader ask, "What do you mean?", then the description should make the reader say, "Oh _that's_ what you mean. I see what this article is going to be about."

] Regardless of how you decide to capitalize your titles, descriptions should always be capitalized as regular sentences. Anything else looks very bizarre to the reader and stands out in a bad way.


# Goals

The goal of writing good titles and descriptions is to attract readers on Google, Twitter, and Facebook but also on your own site. People won't read blog posts just because you write them, you have to make them attractive. So you want to make things interesting and possibly even funny. However, you shouldn't be too obscure as to what you'll be talking about, communicate clearly.
