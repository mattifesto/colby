} Caption

] A caption is text that helps place an image in context for the reader of the document.

] It may or may not describe or provide factual information about the image. It may be funny or personal, but it doesn't have to be. There are few rules to break when using captions except that it should help the user connect to the image.

] It will always be shown to the reader of the document because it provides information about _why_ the image is associated with the document.


} Alternative Text

] Alternative text is provided only to users who are unable to see the image. It is literally an "alternative" to viewing the image.

] Alternative text is only provided to the user in rare cases when the user can't see the image. For example, readers who are sight disabled will have the alternative text read to them by their web browser so they can understand what the image looks like. Alternative text will also be shown in the event that the image can't be downloaded from the server for technical reasons which is very rare.

] One of the most important functions of alternative text is that Google uses it to index your image. Much like a sight disabled person, the Google computers are also "blind" and can only use the alternative text to get an idea of what the image looks like.

] Alternative text should always contain descriptive and factual information about the image with as much detail as possible. It should not be editorial or emotive on its own, however describing the emotion in the image is a good thing. For instance, "A picture of a sad boy.", is good. "A picure of a boy that makes me feel sad.", is bad because it is descriptive of your personal reaction to the image and not the image itself.

] Unlike the caption, the alternative text does not provide context with respect to the document content. Therefore the alternative text for an image would be theoretically the same in all uses of the image on all websites, regardless of context.


# Writing good alternative text and captions

A good perspective is to think of yourself first describing a picure to a blind person (alternative text) and then reading the caption to them. The goal is that they should say, "I get it.", when they hear the caption just as a sighted person would after having seen the actual image.

## Example

} Alternative Text

] Gidget on the beach with a surfboard and a perplexed look on her face. She's wearing a white and oranged striped shirt and pig tails in her hair. Sally Field played Gidget Lawrence on the 1965 television show Gidget.

> The alternative text above is very descriptive and will make sure that Google indexes the site as one containing images of *Sally Field*, *Gidget*, *1965*, and *surfboard* among other terms which will bring more guests to the site.
>
> Without the alternative text, unless the document is literally about the image, there's no way people would find our site even though they might search for all of these terms. Even if the document is about the image, using alternative text tells Google and other search engines in no uncertain terms, "This is what this image looks like. If people are looking for images like I have described, send them to my site."

} Caption Option 1

] Sally Field was awesome as Gidget.

} Caption Option 2

] Nice shirt!

} Caption Option 3

] I wish I knew how to surf!

} Caption Option 4

] She looks like she just lost her best friend.

} Caption Option 5

] Sally Field played Gidget Lawrence on the 1965 television show Gidget.

> The caption sometimes duplicates the alternative text. Remember, readers will most likely never see the alternative text.
