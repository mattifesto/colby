 *
 * The file that used to be this file has been moved to:
 *
 *      classes/Colby/Colby.php
 *
 * Because the Colby class is now so similar to other classes in that it has
 * associated JavaScript and CSS files, all of the Colby files have been moved
 * into the classes/Colby directory. 'Colby' can now be used as a required class
 * name with CBHTMLOutput.
 *
 * Raw system initialization code is being moved to init.php.
