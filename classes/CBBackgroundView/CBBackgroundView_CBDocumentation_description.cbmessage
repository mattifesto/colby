This view is deprecated but still in use by some people. The
CBBackgroundView.css file was added recently to specify (max-width: 100% (code))
to bring the element more in line with the CBView CSS recommendations and fix a
bug. Other root element styles have not been moved to this file to prevent
accidental regressions.
