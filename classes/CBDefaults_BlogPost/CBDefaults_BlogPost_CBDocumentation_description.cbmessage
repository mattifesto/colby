The CBDefaults_BlogPost class has one function, viewSpecs(), that returns the
current recommended set of view specs for a brand new blog post. It would be
used by a blog post page template to create a new page spec so that the page
template wouldn't have to be updated when the set of commonly used blog post
views changes.

At one point in history the CBYouTubeView became a very popular view to have in
a blog post. All of the blog post page templates on each site had to be manually
changed. This class was created to prevent that from needing to be done again.
