/* 1: Setting the line height and min-height is important because of an odd edge
      case. If a CBUIStringEditor is added as display: none, and then is set to
      display: block the textarea will have no height if min-height isn't set.
      By setting the line-height and min-height we can guarantee the heights are
      the same.

      There is still uncertainty regarding fractional pixels. The `font-size`
      property seems to truncate calculated values but height does not. However
      it's undercertain and unlikely that height would not truncte the value.
