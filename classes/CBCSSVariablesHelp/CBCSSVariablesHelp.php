                CBBackgroundColor
                ---

                This color represents the standard background color for the
                theme. The themes are created with the understanding that they
                may be used with custom background colors that will be considered
                either light or dark.

                For CBLightTheme CBBackgroundColor is white. A white background
                is very comfortable and expected for users.

                For CBDarkTheme it is hsl(0, 0%, 10%) because pure black feels too
                strong for comfortable reading. This value has evolved over the
                life of CBDarkTheme because while it's pretty easy to say that black is
                not right color. The correct color is subject to individual situations and emotions
                of the designer. Shades of dark black look visibly different
                even in slightly different layouts.

                --- dt
                CBTextColor
                ---

                CBTextColor is meant to be the color that looks best for the main
                text color. For CBLightTheme it is black with and opacity of 0.9. For
                CBDarkTheme is is white with an opacity of 0.9.

                Pure white or black text is so strong that it can feel awkward. Using opacity
                to mellow the color allows the color to work with elements that have a custom
                background color specified.

                --- dt
                CBTextColor2
                ---

                CBTextColor2 is meant to be used for text that has a reduced
                emphasis compared to other text it is near. It is often used for
                descriptions adjecent to titles, for dates or captions.

                The use of CBTextColor2 is left mostly to the designer, because
                different layouts and views will dictate whether it is appropriate or not.

                --- dt
                CBTextColor3
                ---

                CBTextColor3 is the lightest text color and also appripriate for
                drawing lines.
