CBViewCatalog is a singleton model class. The model is recreated every time the
website is updated and views are required to implement either a CBInstall
interface to register and potentially become available to users editing pages.

CBViewCatalog performs a similar function to SCPromotionExecutorRegistration but
in a different way. The two method are currently being compared to see which is
the better way to more forward with.
