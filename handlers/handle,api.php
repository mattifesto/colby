/**
 * This handler makes calling Ajax functions easier and it provides a simple
 * standard for developing Ajax functions.
 *
 * @param string class
 *
 *     Required. However while the deprecated `className` parameter is still
 *     supported we can't technically require it or it would break old code. But
 *     for new code written, treat it as required.
 *
 * @param string function
 *
 *     Optional. The base name of the function to be called on the class. The
 *     suffix "ForAjax" will be appended to this value if it isn't already
 *     there. So if "go" is the value, `goForAjax` will be the actual function
 *     that will be called on the specified class. If no value is specified, the
 *     default value is "execute" and the `executeForAjax` method will be called
 *     on the specified class. Sometimes a class is built to support a single
 *     Ajax function and when that happens the class name also often describes
 *     the function. In those cases, there's no reason to force a specific
 *     function to be specified also.
 *
 * @param string args
 *
 *     Optional. This is a JSON string that will be decoded and the resulting
 *     value will be used as an argument to the specified function.
 *
 * @return string (JSON)
 *
 *     The recommended behavior is that he called function create a
 *     CBAjaxResponse object and set whatever values on it that are required by
 *     the caller.
 *
 *     The called function takes over the communication with the client. Because
 *     of that, the contract for a response to a successful call to the function
 *     is between the function and the caller, and the function is free to
 *     return data formatted in any way, such as XML. The function should be
 *     documented with its own behavior.
 *
 *     If there is an error such that the function can't be called, a
 *     CBAjaxResponse object will be created to return JSON containing error
 *     information.
